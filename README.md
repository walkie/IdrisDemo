# Introduction to Idris

A brief example-based introduction to Idris, originally for a
[Mini-Workshop][MW] held by the the [Programming Languages and Software
Technology Group][PS] at the University of Marburg.


## Abstract of Talk

Idris is a hip new functional programming language with dependent types. In
this talk I will give a whirlwind tour of some features that make Idris
interesting and fun to use, including: typed laziness, data and codata,
interactive tactic-based theorem proving, extensible syntax, and a
library-level effects system.

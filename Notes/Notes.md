# Introduction to Idris

Idris is a hip new functional programming language with dependent types. In
this talk I will give a whirlwind tour of some features that make Idris
interesting and fun to use, including: typed laziness, data and codata,
interactive tactic-based theorem proving, extensible syntax, static unit tests,
and a library-level effects system.

## Features to show off
 
 * similarity to Haskell
 * dependent types
 * static unit tests
 * typed laziness
 * data and structural recursion
 * codata and guarded recursion
 * interactive tactic-based theorem prover
 * effects system
